Deliverables
1.A	report (in PDF, max. 8 pages) containing at least:
A.	A data preparation part where you explain how you prepared and cleaned the data. This should include the following points
i.	Data merging: explain how you merge the three datasets using python (we recommend using pandasql in python for this section).
ii.	Data cleaning: explain how you handled missing values, possible encoding errors
and outliers, casting columns to the correct type, ... (using python).

iii.	Data transformation: explain how you transformed the data to ensure that it is
in a suitable format for use in the classification model (converting categorical variables to numerical ones,	by using Rapid Miner). Explain also how you
selected the relevant features.

B.	A data exploration part where you explain which patterns, trends, and relationships you identified when performing data exploration. Support the explanation with visualizations
(we recommend using RapidMiner, but you can use the tool that you prefer for visualizations)
C.	modeling part where you explain how your model works. We expect that you at least
test 2 different models and explain them. We recommend using RapidMiner for the modeling part.
D.	An assessment part where you explain how you evaluated the model.
 
E.	A recommendation part where you advise, based on your findings, the NGO about how to prevent child labor in South Africa.
F.	An appendix section (size free) containing at least:
i.	The schematics (a screenshot, not the actual model) of your process in RapidMiner.
ii.	A discussion of the most important design and analysis decision you had to make.
2.	The python code used in a python code format (.py)1. This will be checked to make sure you wrote the python code yourself in Python and not using another tool or by copying it from another group. Every code will be run through a special code plagiarism tool, to check you did not copy
code from the other groups. Plagiarism will be highly sanctioned.
3.	The Rapidminer process (.rmp) used.
4.	The cleaned data frame in CSV format that you used as input for the RapidMiner process.
5.	A prediction file in CSV format, where the first column will contain the IDs of unlabelled children, and the second column will contain a 0 if your model predicts that the child is not involved in child labor and a 1 if your model predicts that the child is involved in child labor. Refer to unlabelled_data.csv.
6.	A presentation, in PDF, of maximum 8 slides (without counting possible backup slides, of which the number is free but will not be considered for the grading). This presentation should show the ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù of your report, emphasizing business‚Äêrelevant conclusions and findings. This is the

Dataset 3
One line/record is one child.
For the Q54TIME and Q72TIME questions the questions were asked in a slightly different way. Instead of asking how many hours per week they spent doing a certain activity, they were asked how many hours they spent on that activity each day of the week. So, their data was recorded by day instead of being added up for the whole week. This level of detail per day is included in dataset 3. You need to aggregate this back to the number of hours per week.
